# Seed Image Dataset

## Dataset Overview
This dataset comprises images of seeds from 10 different species, with 8 images per species, for a total of 80 images. The images were taken in laboratory conditions using a portable USB microscope (Opti-Tekscope) with a resolution of 1600 pixels by 1200 pixels per image. Each image represents an area of 2 cm by 1.5 cm. The zoom level remained fixed for all seed images, but small optical tuning was made during data collection to focus the lens of the microscope.


## File Naming Convention
Each file is named following the convention `###_speciesname.jpg`, where `speciesname` is the common name of the seed species, and `###` is a three-digit identifier ranging from 001 to 080.

## How to Use This Dataset
This dataset is intended for educational purposes, specifically for teaching machine learning concepts related to image classification. Users are encouraged to split the dataset into training and validation sets, ensuring representation from all species in both sets. A stratified split approach is recommended to maintain the proportion of images per species across different sets.
