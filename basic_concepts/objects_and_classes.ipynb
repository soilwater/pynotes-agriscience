    "Python's programming approach is centered around objects, a concept that encapsulates data and functionality. In Python, everything you use —be it variables, modules, or figures— is an object. This approach is part of what we call object-oriented programming (OOP), which is useful because it organizes code into small, reusable pieces, making it easier to understand and maintain. Think of objects as mini-programs that have their own properties (like characteristics or data) and methods (functions or actions they can perform). \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, objects often have both properties and methods. A property is like an attribute of an object, while a method is a function that belongs to the object and usually performs some action or computation related to the object. Methods are called with parentheses and may take arguments.\n",

    "Consider a scenario where we operate a soil analysis laboratory receiving samples from various clients, such as farmers, gardeners, and golf course superintendents.

These attributes might include the client's full name, the date the sample was received, a unique identifier, the location of sample collection, the analyses requested, and the results of these analyses. In this context, the primary unit of interest is the individual sample, and all the additional information represents its metadata.\n",
