    "`For` loops are essential in programming for executing a block of code multiple times, automating repetitive tasks efficiently. They are particularly useful in data science for iterating through various data structures like lists and dictionaries. Unlike conventional counting that starts from 1, Python's `for loops` begin at index 0, iterating over sequences starting from the first element. \n",

    "## Example 3: Combine `for` loop with `if` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining a `for` loop with `if` statements unleashes a powerful and precise control over data processing and decision-making within iterative sequences. The `for` loop provides a structured way to iterate over a range of elements in a collection, such as lists, tuples, or strings. When an `if` statement is nested within this loop, it introduces conditional logic, allowing the program to execute specific blocks of code only when certain criteria are met. This combination is incredibly versatile: it can be used for filtering data, conditional aggregation of data, and applying different operations to elements based on specific conditions.\n",

    "### Example 3a\n",
    "In this short example we will combine a `for` loop with `if` statements to generate the complementary DNA strand by iterating over each nucleotide. The code will also filter if there is an incorrect base and in which position that incorrect base is located.\n"
