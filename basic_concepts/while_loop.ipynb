    "\n",
    "The `iter()` function is used to create an iterator from an iterable object, like a list or a dictionary. Once you have an iterator, you can use the `next()` function to sequentially access elements from the iterator. Each call to `next()` retrieves the next element in the sequence. When `next()` reaches the end of the sequence and there are no more elements to return, it raises a `StopIteration` exception. This combination of a loop and `iter()` allows for a controlled iteration process, especially useful in situations where you need to process elements one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `strip()` method removes any leading and trailing whitespace (like spaces, tabs, or new lines) from the input string. This is helpful to ensure that extra spaces do not affect the comparison of the user's guess to the correct answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `lower()` method then converts the string to lowercase. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, meaning that \"Oxisols\", \"oxisols\", and \"OXISOLS\" are all treated as the same guess."
