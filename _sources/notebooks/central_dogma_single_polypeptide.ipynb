    "# Central Dogma: Decoding a Single Polypeptide\n",
    "\n",
    "*The DNA is the carrier of genetic information and its simplest form can be viewed as a long string of characters that encode biological features and attributes*\n",
    "\n",
    "The central dogma of molecular biology consists of a two step process to convert the information contained in DNA sequences into proteins. These steps are transcription (DNA into messenger RNA) and translation (messenger RNA into aminoacids). The RNA polymerase is an enzyme that participates in the transcription process, while ribosomes are large molecular structures that translate messenger RNA into a chain of aminoacids to form polypetides and proteines.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Figure: A gene is expressed through the processes of transcription and translation.\n",
    "During transcription, the enzyme RNA polymerase (green) uses DNA as a template to produce a pre-mRNA transcript (pink). The pre-mRNA is processed to form a mature mRNA molecule that can be translated to build the protein molecule (polypeptide) encoded by the original gene.\n",
    "Source: Nature Education.**\n",

    "You can learn more by reading an excellent educational article by [Suzanne Clancy and William Brown (2008)](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/translation-dna-to-mrna-to-protein-393/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **goal** of this exercise is to use Python to emulate both the RNA polymerase and a ribosome to decode the aminoacids present in a sequence of DNA. To accomplish this goal we will need a DNA sequence and a lookup table to convert codons into aminoacids. I transcribed the information in the table below into a JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.nature.com/scitable/content/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/105292568/44376_38b.jpg\">\n",

    "**Figure: The large ribosomal subunit binds to the small ribosomal subunit to complete the initiation complex.\n",
    "The initiator tRNA molecule, carrying the methionine amino acid that will serve as the first amino acid of the polypeptide chain, is bound to the P site on the ribosome. The A site is aligned with the next codon, which will be bound by the anticodon of the next incoming tRNA. Source: Nature Education.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Codons refer to the triplets in the mRNA. The triplets in the sequence of transfer RNA (tRNA) are called anti-codons and are complementary to the codons in the mRNA. In the figure above, `AUG` (in the 5' to 3' mRNA) is the codon for Methionine, while `UAC` (in the tRNA) is the anti-codon for Methionine\n",
    "\n",
    "There are total of 23 essential aminoacids that encoded in codons consisting of three bases. Some codons are dedicated at instructing the ribosomes the START or STOP of the sequence. The genetic code includes 64 possible permutations, or combinations, of three-letter nucleotide sequences that can be made from the four nucleotides. Of the 64 codons, 61 represent amino acids, and three are stop signals. For example, the codon CAG represents the amino acid glutamine, and TAA is a stop codon. The genetic code is described as degenerate, or redundant, because a single amino acid may be coded for by more than one codon. When codons are read from the nucleotide sequence, they are read in succession and do not overlap with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "* For simplicity we will ignore additional portions of DNA such as promoter and a terminator regions that play an important role during transcription, but that do not contribute the sequence of the polypeptide.\n",
    "\n",
    "* All bases will be represented in upper case for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will assume that the ribosome is made of a single unit and contains a single activation site. So basically a simplified version of the figure above.\n",

For clarity, notice that this tool already provides the complementary DNA strand. Since in this exercise we are also implementing the transcription step I reversed the DNA sequence obtained from the website. Here is the original DNA strand that I obtained from the online tool: `atggataaagtgacggcaggcaacgtgatgcttgccttcggcacgagtctggttgtgcaggtcgttgtttcttga`, which I reversed using the code from the `complementaty DNA sequence` exercise. If you don't do this step, the code will still decode aminoacids, but the resulting polypeptide will not look right (i.e. Methionine will not be the first aminoacid). I simply reversed the DNA strand to closely match textbook examples and available material online."

The location of the `raise` statement is crucial since we only want to trigger this action if a certain condition is met (i.e. we find an unknown base). So, we will place the `raise` statement inside the `if` statement within the `for` loop. We will also return the location in the sequence of the unknown base using the `find()` method. \n",
