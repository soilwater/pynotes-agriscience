    "# While loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to a `for loop`, a `while loop` is intended to iterate over a specific set of lines of code. However, the need for a `while loop` might not be as clear to new programmers as with `for loops`. The difference is in that a `while loop` runs indefinetely until a certain condition is met, which means that in some cases the code could run forever if the condition is never met. In a `while loop` the interpreter is constatnly running the code and checking to whether a specific condition is met or not. If not, then the code runs one more time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the `while loop` is simple and its syntax in Python is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    code goes here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A = 0\n",
    "while A < 3:\n",
    "    A += 1\n",
    "    print(A)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above we initialize a variable `A` with a value of zero. We then create a `while loop` that will iterate over the code. Note that there is no index, as with the `for loop`. The `while loop` is constatnly checking the condition defined at the top in each iteration. This means that within the code it should be possible to turn the conditonal statement from `True` to `False`. If at some point the condition is no longer `True`, then the loop will break and the Python will continue with other lines (if any) after the `while loop`.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In Python empty variables are considered `False`, and non-empty variables are considered `True`. We can use this fact to succintly implement a condition in a `while loop`. For instance: `while len(a) > 0:` could be replaced by `while a:`\n"
