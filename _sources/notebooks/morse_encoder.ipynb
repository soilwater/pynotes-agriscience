    "Use Python to encode a string into the International Morse Code system. Morse code is a character encoding scheme used in telecommunication that encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations called dots and dashes or dits and dahs. Morse code is named for Samuel F. B. Morse, the inventor of the telegraph [1]\n",

    "## Step 1: Break down the problem into smaller pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "When we follow a tutorial we typically see nice and logically-organized code. However, we hardly ever write code like this. Instead, we try to break down the problem into smaller components and we test these smaller components. Then, we assemble the code, where new challenges will likely emerge. So, there are several iterations of the polishing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are few of the steps that I envisioned before writing the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search or create a lookup table of English characters and Morse codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iterate over each character of the input string\n",

My first script was unable to handle spaces and was crashing even for something like `Hello world`. So, I focused on getting the right answer for just `Hello`. If I can retrive the correct Morse codes for a simple word, then it means that I'm close. Aim at accomplishing small steps and then proceed. After savoring small victories I feel motivated and engaged to resolve the next step."

    "## Step 3: Load lookup table\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have a text file with two columns (character and code), it's pretty obvious that Pandas is a good alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas linrary also allows for logical indexing, which means that we can use a vector of Booleans to easily retrieve information from specific column cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "To load the lookuptable into Python we need few pieces of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. URL for the file\n",
    "2. File delimiter\n",
    "3. Parser engine to use. We will use the python engine, which is more feature-complete. The default parser will throw an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading the lookup table we will display the entire dataframe to double-check that everything is loaded as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: I had no idea that Python has different parsers. I first thought that my code was crashing because I encoded something wrong in the text file and that Python was having a hard time to read my file. Much of this problem arose after I added characters such as apostrophes to my lookup table. So, I first found a thread in StackOverflow and then I went to the [Pandas official documentation](<https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html)...and there it was!, a succint but nice explanation about parser engines."
