Many meteorological and physiological process are related to solar radiation and/or temperature patterns. The day of the year provides a convenient date-agnostic framework to predict these patterns without much additional data.\n",

If you also want to return the fraction of DOY, then you need to realize that 0.5 would 1-Jan at noon. However, most applications demanding the DOY will assume that 1-Jan is day 1 and not day 0. If this is what you need, then directly working in seconds as a proxy for a serial dates number might be the way to go.\n"
