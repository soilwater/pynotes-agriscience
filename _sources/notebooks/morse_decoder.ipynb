    "# Morse code decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to decode a message written using Morse code. Morse code consists of dits and dahs to represent alphanumeric characters. Although there are rules for the spacing between letters and words, in this case there is a single space between individual Morse codes and three spaces between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lookup table of Morse codes and characters is available in the Dataset folder. We will use the Pandas library to read the lookup table and also to identify the different codes and match them with the right letter of the alphabet. The message that we will decode is: \n",

    "\"Ad Astra per Aspera\", which is a Latin expression that means \"To the Stars through Difficulties\" and is the motto of the state of Kansas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first approach will be simple and will ignore some technical issues (e.g. spacing between words). Our goal is to decode the message and to print it in a human readable format. If we can achieve this, then we can spend more time embellishing the output and polishing technical aspects. The solution assumes that the encoded message is a single long string of Morse codes without breaklines.\n",

In fact, the `.split()` method removed all the spaces between codes so we can use the remaining empty strings to separate words. Again, maybe not ideal, but this is something we can fix later. **We made great progress splitting up the encoded message into individual Morse codes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Match codes and characters\n",
    "Now that we have the different Morse codes separated into individual elements of a list we need to find a way of matching each code in the encoded string with the Morse code in the lookup, and then we will use the position of the matched Morse code to retrieve the corresponding character. This is similar to what we would do if we solve this problem by hand, it's just that we normally overlook tiny crucial steps. For instance, you may say: *sure after finding the matching Morse code we need to select the character located in the same matching row*, but we need to tell the computer all these tiny decisions, so that it can replicate what we do by hand using pencil and paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start testing our approach with a single code. At this point it's common for beginners to start writing loops and if statements without ensuring that the task that will be iterated works as expected. A simple test using a trivial case can save substantial amount of time."
