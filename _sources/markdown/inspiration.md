## Great quotes 

These are great quotes obtained from the video and the official code.org website:

>“I think that great programming is not all that dissimilar to great art. Once you start thinking in concepts of programming it makes you a better person...as does learning a foreign language, as does learning math, as does learning how to read.“ —*Jack Dorsey. Creator, Twitter. Founder and CEO, Square*

>“Software touches all of these different things you use, and tech companies are revolutionizing all different areas of the world...from how we shop to how farming works, all these things that aren't technical are being turned upside down by software. So being able to play in that universe really makes a difference.“ —*Drew Houston. Founder & CEO, Dropbox*

>“To prepare humanity for the next 100 years, we need more of our children to learn computer programming skills, regardless of their future profession. Along with reading and writing, the ability to program is going to define what an educated person is.“ —*Salman Khan. Founder, Khan Academy*

>“Learning to speak the language of information gives you the power to transform the world.“ —*Peter Denning. Association of Computing Machinery, former President*

>“Learning to write programs stretches your mind, and helps you think better, creates a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful in all domains.“ —*Bill Gates. Chairman, Microsoft*

>“The programmers of tomorrow are the wizards of the future. You're going to look like you have magic powers compared to everybody else“ —*Gabe Newell. Founder and President, Valve*


## Skill acquisition

Following the Dreyfus scale of skill acquisition, the goal of these notes is to make you a **competent** python programmer, meaning that you will be able to automate simple tasks, analyze datasets, and create a reproducible and logical code that support scientific claims in the domain of agricultural sciences. 

**Scale levels**

    Novice | Competent | Proficient | Expert | Mastery


## Brief history of coding languages in Science

Timeline of programming languages. Source:[Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline_of_programming_languages)

* 1958 - Fortran II
* 1964 - BASIC (Soil Physics with Basic by Gaylon. Campbell)
* 1970 - Pascal
* 1972 - C (Low level, base of other languages: C++,Java,JavaScript,C#,PHP, Python)
* 1976 - SAS
* 1978 - [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
* 1989 - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* 1990 - HTML (physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, used for documentation)
* 1993 - [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* 1995 - Java, PHP, Javascript, Ruby
* 2012 - [Julia](https://julialang.org/)

## Why Python?

Python is a free, multi-purpose (analyze data, create applications, create websites, create games), and highly popular language with a large community of users in scientific fields. As a result, Python has a vast ecosystem of high-level scientific modules that makes the transition into the coding world a lot easier to beginners.
