# Good Coding Habits

Writing clean and human-readable code requires consistency and the adoption of good programming practices and habits. This section is about some coding good habits for beginners.


## Good coding habits

* Before running any code, set an expectation for the output. Whether you are running a simple `print` statement or several lines of code, ensuring that you are obtaining the desired outcome will prevent that errors accumulate and propagate in your code.

* Use cell mode in Jupyter notebooks to break down the problem into smaller pieces. Write and test the code for each cell before proceeding to the next part of the problem. Cell mode will help you to partition the problem in logical order and facilitate the addition of documentation between cells.

* Add one to three sentences at the beginning of any function or script describing the purpose of the code. Succiently provide references to websites, books, or research manuscripts.

* When defining inputs, outputs, and the intermediate equations of a model from a book or manuscript, add a comment with the units and equation number next to the line of code.

* Use descriptive variable names. Err on the verbose side instead of assigning cryptic variable names. Exceptions may apply when coding equations from a specific source. In that case, document the page number and/or equation number as a comment next to each line of code mentioned earlier.

* Write descriptive variable names using underscores (e.g. air_temperature)

* Function names should be all lower case with no underscores (e.g. thermaltime()).

* Add a space before and after equal the equal sign and some operations to improve readability (e.g. C = (F -32) * 5/9).
