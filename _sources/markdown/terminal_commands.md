# Useful Terminal Commands

While some tools like Github now have some graphical user interfaces, terminal commands can be quite handy for cloning repositories, committing changes, pushing updates, and even installing new python modules. Something you almost always need to do in the terminal is to navigate directories. Here are some of the most typical commands and shortcuts to get you started.

## General commands (Mac terminal or Git Bash)

`cd <foldername>` change directory; navigate into a new folder (assuming the folder exists in the directory).

`cd ..` To navigate out of the current directory

`ls` To list the content of the folder

`pwd` full path to current directory

See image below where I ran these commands:

## Useful shortcuts

Use `Tab key` to autocomplete directory and file names

Use `arrow-up` to access the last command

In Macs use `cmd + v` to paste text into the terminal

In Windows machines use `shift + insert` to paste text into Git bash
