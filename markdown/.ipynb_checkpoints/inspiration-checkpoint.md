# Inspiration

A short video created by [code.org](https://www.code.org) to increase awareness about the importance of code literacy. The footage includes the humble beginnings of successful coders and entrepreneurs that revolutionized the tech industry through code.

>“I think that great programming is not all that dissimilar to great art. Once you start thinking in concepts of programming it makes you a better person...as does learning a foreign language, as does learning math, as does learning how to read.“ —*Jack Dorsey. Creator, Twitter. Founder and CEO, Square*

>“Software touches all of these different things you use, and tech companies are revolutionizing all different areas of the world...from how we shop to how farming works, all these things that aren't technical are being turned upside down by software. So being able to play in that universe really makes a difference.“ —*Drew Houston. Founder & CEO, Dropbox*

>“To prepare humanity for the next 100 years, we need more of our children to learn computer programming skills, regardless of their future profession. Along with reading and writing, the ability to program is going to define what an educated person is.“ —*Salman Khan. Founder, Khan Academy*

>“Learning to speak the language of information gives you the power to transform the world.“ —*Peter Denning. Association of Computing Machinery, former President*

>“Learning to write programs stretches your mind, and helps you think better, creates a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful in all domains.“ —*Bill Gates. Chairman, Microsoft*

>“The programmers of tomorrow are the wizards of the future. You're going to look like you have magic powers compared to everybody else“ —*Gabe Newell. Founder and President, Valve*

## Dreyfus scale of skill acquisition

    Novice | Competent | Proficient | Expert | Mastery

The goal of these notes is to make you a **competent** python programmer, meaning that you will be able to automate simple tasks, analyze datasets, and create a reproducible and logical code blueprints that support scientific claims. The idea of the material is to get you

## Some programming stats

* Computing occupations are the number 1 source of all new wages in the U.S. 
* Computing occupations make up over half of all projected new jobs in STEM fields.
* Kansas currently has 2,313 open computing jobs
* Kansas had only 338 computer science graduates in 2015; only 14% were female.
* The average salary for a computing occupation in KS is 77,116, higher than average salary in the state (44,570).

## Role of coding in my career

* One of the most important skills that I've learned in gradaute school
* Before coding I was confined into analysis of variance and significant differences. Coding enabled spatio-temporal analysis, numerical simulation of physically-based processes, curve fitting and parameter optimization
* Coding forced me to think logically, break down a large problem into smaller pieces, and increase attention to seemingly irrelevant details
* Track the work and reasoning of students (and colleagues).
* Ability to materialize an idea into something that other people can use

## Brief history of coding languages in Science

Timeline of programming languages. Source:[Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline_of_programming_languages)

* 1958 - Fortran II
* 1964 - BASIC (Soil Physics with Basic by Gaylon. Campbell)
* 1970 - Pascal
* 1972 - C (Low level, base of other languages: C++,Java,JavaScript,C#,PHP, Python)
* 1976 - SAS
* 1978 - [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
* 1989 - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* 1990 - HTML (physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, used for documentation)
* 1993 - [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* 1995 - Java, PHP, Javascript, Ruby
* 2012 - [Julia](https://julialang.org/)

## Why Python?

* Multi-purpose language (analyze data, create software, websites)
* Most popular language in science, large community, lots of online resources
* Syntax somewhat similar to that of Matlab (at least in packages like Numpy and Scipy)
* Free
