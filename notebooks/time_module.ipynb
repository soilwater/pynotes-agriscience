To handle all these possibilities, the Python time module has a `strftime()` method to print the same information in multiple formats. The format largely depends on the application. For instance, if we are interested in a process that changes on daily time steps, then we can probably omit hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds from the output, so that it is legible and clear to the user or reader of that date. Below I present few examples to show you the basic syntax. Feel free to try any of the following formats.\n",
