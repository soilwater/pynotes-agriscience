    "Building up on top of concepts and lines of codes from previous exercises we will create a set of functions to decode DNA sequences with multiple polypeptides.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is handy and the entire blueprint on how to do DNA transcription is encapsulated in a single function that we can invoke anytime we need to conver DNA into mRNA, very much like invoking an enzyme to do the job for us. \n",
    "\n",
    ">In some cases your code will start as a script, but it may end up a little longer than our previous script and may also contain the solution to multiple processes, in which case I suggest partitioning the script into multiple functions, each function being specific with a well defined purpose."

    "\n",
    "To check for potential typos in the sequence of DNA or to prevent that the user feeds a sequence of mRNA instead of DNA to the transcription function, we will use the `raise` statement, which will automatically stop and exit the `for` loop and throw a custom error message if the code finds a base a base other than A,T,C, or G. The location of the `raise` statement is crucial since we only want to trigger this action if a certain condition is met (i.e. we find an unknown base). So, we will place the `raise` statement inside the `if` statement within the `for` loop. We will also return the location in the sequence of the unknown base using the `find()` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "The error catching method described above is simple and practical for small applications, but it has some limitations. For instance, we cannot identify whether there are more than one unknwon bases and we cannot let the user know the location of all these bases. Nonetheless, this is a good starting point."
