    "Imagine a code in which the user passes data in degrees Fahrenheit and we need to convert these data into degrees Celsius. Instead of typing the equation every time you need to conver temperatures, we can write the expression for converting temperature units into a `lambda` function that we can call whenever we need it. Functions are just that, code encapsulated behind a name that we can invoke by simply calling its name. This way we avoid repeating code and we minimize the risk of making mistakes since we only write the main equation one time.\n",

However, if we are writing a simple Python script that requires computation of vepor pressure in multiple places, let's say within a for loop, then using a lambda function can become practical. Again, one of the best advantages is that we code the formula only once, minimizing the chances of introducing typos, particularly, when typing coefficients.\n",
